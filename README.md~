Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

**Visitors**

As a visitor, I can view all the heroes.

    When I view all the heros
    Then I can see names of all heros

As a visitor, I can see information about any individual hero so that I can see their stats.

    Rule: Heroes have an image, real name, hero name, height, weight, special power, intelligence, strength, power, speed, agility, description, and story.

    Given I have the name of a hero
    When I retreive the hero
    Then I can view all the details for that hero

    Given I have an incorrect hero name
    When I retreive details for that hero
    Then I receive a message that it doesn't exist
